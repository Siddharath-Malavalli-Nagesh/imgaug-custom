# Changed documentation and license

All links have been replaced by targets which
are controlled by members of the `imaug` GitHub
[organization](https://github.com/imaug).

A new RTD page has been created directly
from the repository. The `readthedocs.yml` was modified
accordingly.

The installation instruction have changed and only
mention the directly installation from GitHub (for now).

The new organisation is mentioned in `LICENSE`.
